<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Omnara">
    Choose your preferred package manager:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    pip install omnara
    ```

    ```bash homebrew
    brew install omnara
    ```

    ```bash uv
    uv tool install omnara
    ```

    ```bash pipx
    pipx install omnara
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your Agent">
    Launch Claude Code with dashboard integration:

    ```bash
    omnara
    ```

    On first run, this will:
    1. Open your browser for authentication
    2. Prompt you to sign in to Omnara (or create an account)
    3. Automatically save your API key to `~/.omnara/credentials.json`

    Everything you do in the terminal is now synced to your [dashboard](https://omnara.com/dashboard) and mobile app.

    <Tip>
    Authentication happens automatically on first run. You can also explicitly authenticate with `omnara --auth` if needed.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try Other Modes">
    Explore different usage patterns:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Headless
    # Run in background without terminal UI
    omnara headless --prompt "Review this codebase"
    ```

    ```bash Webhook Server
    # Enable remote triggering
    omnara serve
    ```

    ```bash Different Agent
    # Use Codex instead of Claude Code
    omnara --agent codex
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication fails">
    ```bash
    # Try re-authenticating
    omnara --reauth

    # Or set API key manually
    export OMNARA_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    omnara
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent not found">
    Ensure the agent CLI is installed:

    ```bash
    # Claude Code
    claude --version

    # Codex (packaged with Omnara)
    # Should work out of the box

    # Amp
    amp --version
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dashboard not updating">
    1. Check you're not using `--no-relay`
    2. Verify internet connection
    3. Check logs: `~/.omnara/<agent>_wrapper/<session-id>.log`
